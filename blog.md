<h1>Gohu</h1>

> "Gohufont is a monospace bitmap font well suited for programming and terminal use. It is intended to be very legible and offers very discernable glyphs for all characters, including signs and symbols."

With bitmaps for two sizes, normal and bold, this is a very simple and practical font. All character shapes are different, so no confusion between o's and zeros. If you're up for tiny aliased type, you can fit loads of code on a screen with Gohu.

<h1>Crystal</h1>

Not much is known about this seemingly freely available font. It has a slashed zero, but lacks bold and italic. Also, it's character set is very limited and omits things like the euro and copyright signs (although it does include box drawing characters).

<h1>Everson Mono</h1>

> "Everson Mono is a simple, elegant, monowidth font. I started designing it in 1994 primarily to make glyphs available to support the non-Han characters in Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646, though I hope that users may find it a pleasant alternative to Courier and Monaco for general purposes, e-mail, and so forth. I have found it quite legible at sizes as small as 4 points. It is lighter and a bit looser than Courier."

Michael Everson's project has been running for over 20 years. As a result this is a well rounded font  with impressive coverage. In recent years it has been updated with bold and italic versions. The interests of the creator of Everson Mono are reflected in the many languages in Evertype Publishing's portfolio. As a writer's font, it lacks a distinct zero.

<h1>Selectric</h1>

This font, that seems to be available freely, has a name that refers to the IBM Selectric. Like Courier before it, it seems to be derived from that typewriter. It might not be the best choice for coding (no distinct zero), but good typewriter fonts are still great for writing.

<h1>Terminus</h1>

> "Terminus Font is a clean, fixed width bitmap font, designed for long (8 and more hours per day) work with computers. Version 4.39 contains 891 characters, covers about 120 language sets and supports ISO8859-1/2/5/7/9/13/15/16, Paratype-PT154/PT254, KOI8-R/U/E/F, Esperanto, many IBM, Windows and Macintosh code pages, as well as the IBM VGA, vt100 and xterm pseudographic characters."

Terminus is a very complete bitmap font, with very clean and clear rendering at a number of sizes. It's coverage is impressive, and even features a bold weight. The zero is slahed to set it apart. Sadly the links on the sourceforge site are broken.

[...](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Anonymous+Pro)

Designed by [Mark Simonson](http://www.marksimonson.com), Anonymous Pro is an evolution of the original [Anonymous](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Anonymous), adding lots of character sets and styles. It covers [all the characters (624 glyphs), styles and weights anyone will ever need](http://www.marksimonson.com/assets/content/fonts/AnonymousProSpecimen.pdf), and with all characters easily distinguishable. For fans of having lots of code on screen, it even features bitmap versions for really tiny characters (without anti-aliasing). It's a truly professional option with a splash of character.

<h1>GNU Freefont</h1>

[...](https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/)

This isn't a designer's font, but an open source community effort to create a single font that has it all. It comes in bold and italic and has the most complete coverage of any font featured on this blog. While an OS will mix and match fonts for missing glyphs FreeFont looks to be a consistent source for anything mankind has ever put into writing. Still, every now and then new releases [improve the offering](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=freefont). If you need specific scripts or write a lot of math in LateX, this font will not let you down. It would have been better with a more distinct zero though, it lacks a slash or dot to set it apart from the capital o.

<h1>Fifteen</h1>

>"Fifteen is a faux bitmap font. This font is designed to be used as a monotype font for use in a terminal, or at a larger size, to look like an over scaled bitmap. It is designed for 15 pixel use. It is as narrow as I could make it, and works well in a 132 column terminal window."
[...](http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/fifteen)

This is not just some programming font. It's designed like a bitmap font, but built as an outline font for maximum compatibility. That does however mean it only looks good at 15 pixels and doesn't have any true bold or italic styles. Indeed, it seems it could not have been made any more narrow: it is supremely efficient at getting lots of code on the screen without sacrificing readability. Fifteen is nearly halve the width of Cousine or Droid Sans, ideal for digging though log files.

This font was designed by Steve Matteson, more widely known for his work on the Droid fontfaces you'll find on any Android device. It was created especially for on-screen use, and covers regular, bold and italic in an amazing 2391 Glyphs. Compatibility might be its strongest feat, but it's a serious font for every day use.

<h1>Source Code Pro</h1>

> "One particularly surprising aspect of Source Sans’s release was the amount of interest generated by the teaser graphic of the monospaced version. It seemed that this generated about as much buzz as the fonts that we released. Brackets, the open source code editor created by Adobe, has just recently implemented the regular weight of Source Code into their project. Likewise, the font will be integrated into Adobe Edge Code, which was announced this morning at our Create the Web event in San Francisco. The complete family of six weights will also be available as part of our new Adobe Edge Web Fonts service."
[...](http://blog.typekit.com/2012/09/24/source-code-pro/)

Source Sans Pro has been one of the most succesful new, free and designed-for-screen fonts to surface the past few years. Developing an additional monospaced font for code only makes sense. It's modern but still with a notion of playfulness, and special attention has been paid to make every character easily distinguishable. It features an impressive 963 glyphs in seven (yes, 7) weights ranging from ExtraLight to Black. And if all of that is not amazing enough, it has been open sourced on Github and has seen regular updates. An italic version is currently in beta. It's great to see Adobe open sourcing this truly wonderful font.

Most fonts work fine on a Mac, the best ones add hinting for The Windows ClearType system, but a scarce few pay special attention to the FreeType rendering used in Linux. Oxygen was created to work well in KDE, and this mono variation is a great choice for programmers on Linux. It features a slashed zero and 397 glyphs are enough for pretty much anyone, although purists would prefer true bold and italic.

As such it was meant to look great on screen. Matching Ubuntu's mission, the family covers and impressive list of languages and scripts.

<h1>Inconsolata</h1>

> "Inconsolata is my first serious original font release. It is a monospace font, designed for printed code listings and the like. There are a great many "programmer fonts," designed primarily for use on the screen, but in most cases do not have the attention to detail for high resolution rendering.
Inconsolata draws from many inspirations and sources. I was particularly struck by the beauty of Luc(as) de Groot's Consolas, which is his monospaced design for Microsoft's Vista release. This font, similar to his earlier TheSansMono, demonstrated clearly to me that monospaced fonts do not have to suck."
[...](http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html)

Inconsolata, inspired (also in name) by Consolas, is very well made and easy on the eyes. Its creator is a [Google Android engineer](http://www.levien.com/), who was also involved with Google Fonts. Although this font doesn't come from a foundry it shows the designer knew what he was doing. If there is a downside it's a lack of coverage (291 glyphs) of certain scripts and true bold and italics.

For some reason it lacks a true italic, and it should better distinguish o's and zeros, but it supports more languages that you can swing a smartphone at.

<h1>Generic Mono</h1>

> "A generic monospaced font"
[...](http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/generic-mono)

Hard to say much about a font is so generic and proud of it. It's functional on non-offensive, but it's limited coverage and lack of bold and italics hold it back. It's hard to fault its basic design though, and it's very new, so who knows what the future holds for this font.

<h1>Profont</h1>

> "ProFont began life as a better version of Monaco 9 which is especially good for programmers."
[...](http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/fonts/profont/MProFont/profontdoc.txt)

Designed during the Eighties specifically for coding, this font has all the important features: readability at small sizes, a slashed zero, disting i's and 1's. The original font had bitmaps for a range of sizes, the more recent (and Mac compatible) versions are outline fonts. Perhaps the bitmaps (turn antialiasing off) are still the best, even though this retro trip isn't for everyone (nor does it work everywhere). You'll also have to do without bold and italic. Get the version for your system from [Tobias Young](http://tobiasjung.name/profont/index.php?fs=12&pf=on).

<h1>Consolamono</h1>

The font is updated now (2011.06.17) - I made all glyphs for Latin Extended B, Cyrillic, and Cyrillic Supplement. Added Bold version 2012.11.16 2013.01.27"
[...](http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/consolamono)

This is a beautiful, rounded font with tons of character. While it might not look like the most obvious choice for a programming font it's very well made and its coverage is very good. Consolamono doesn't come with true italics. However, if you're looking for something fun and different, this might just be it.

Conceived as the "the mutant child of Comic Sans and Helvetica Neue", this is fun as a programming font can get (legally at least).

<h1>Lekton</h1>

Originally designed by [a group of students at ISIA Urbino](http://lektongroups.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/luglio-2008.html), this font was inspired by some of the typefaces used on the Olivetti typewriters. It is monospaced because the typewriter fonts were like that too. A programmer may fault it for its lack of a distint zero, but on the upside it features 953 glyphs in regular, bold and italic. Perhaps not surprising considering its origin, Lekton is really a writers typeface.

Cutive is a thin and light typewriter font with subtle serifs. A fresh and modern take on the classic style, this wonderful writer's typeface covers the basic western character set. It doesn't have true bold and italic, and zero's and o's aren't very distinct, but that shouldn't hold you back. Get your Hemingway on and blog away with this modern classic.

The DejaVu project is open source at its best.

You might not have missed the Turkish Lira sign, but if you did you'll be glad to know it has recently been added. DejaVu has an amazing coverage and has all the styles you'll ever need. It's classic and understated and the goto font for many coders.

<h1>Courier New</h1>

Monotype created a new digital outline Courier by taking the character shapes directly from the Selectric typewriter's [golf ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Selectric_typewriter). This resulted in much thinner characters. This font was featuredin Windows 3.1 alongside the original raster Courier. Tweaks have later been made to make the thin font look acceptable in Windows ClearType.

<h1>Liberation Mono</h1>

There are three sets: Sans (a substitute for Arial, Albany, Helvetica, Nimbus Sans L, and Bitstream Vera Sans), Serif (a substitute for Times New Roman, Thorndale, Nimbus Roman, and Bitstream Vera Serif) and Mono (a substitute for Courier New, Cumberland, Courier, Nimbus Mono L, and Bitstream Vera Sans Mono)."
[...](https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/)

Red Hat sponsored Steve Matteson in 2007 to create a set of fonts it could package with its Linux distribution. The family features metrically compatible replacements for Arial and Times New Roman, as well as a monospaced Courier replacement. While it lacks a distinct zero, this is a solid font with 665 glyphs and true bold and italic.

<h1>Quinze</h1>

> "Quinze is a narrow monospaced font, for programming and terminal emulators. It is designed to be narrow, and allow 132 columns to be comfortably fitted on a screen The 1, l and I are clearly distinguished, as are O and 0. The ascii circumflex is presented as an arrow, consistent with its use as exponentiation operator."
[...](http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/fifteen)

Like Fifteen, Quinze was made to fit lots of code on a line. It's very narrow but still readable. Where Fifteen is a faux bitmap font that only really works at 15 pixels, Quinze is a true outline font. It has all the features required of a programming font, but lacks true bold and italic and its character set is a bit limited. A bit of a specialist font perhaps, but well executed and usefull.

<h1>Fixedsys</h1>

> "Fixedsys is a family of raster monospaced fonts. The name means fixed system, because its glyphs are monospace or fixed-width (although bolded characters are wider than non-bolded, unlike other monospace fonts such as Courier). It is the oldest font in Windows, and was the system font in Windows 1.0 and 2.0, where it was simply named "System". For Windows 3.x, the system font was changed to a proportional sans-serif font named System, but Fixedsys remained the default font in Notepad."

Switch to black on white, turn of anti-aliasing, set it to 10 pixels and imagine yourself back in a time when [Madonna was ground-breaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mxzs649t4) and you could get shoes with lights that would blink as you walked. Awesome? Yes. Would you want to go back? Definitely, but perhaps not indefinitely.

The origin story for this font is mind boggling, as is its [coverage of languages](http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/average-mono) (Urdu or Runic anyone?). Not unlikely one enabled the other.

I have found it quite legible at sizes as small as 4 points. It is lighter and a bit looser than Courier."

Michael Everson's project has been running for over 20 years. As a result this is a well rounded font  with impressive coverage. In recent years it has been updated with bold and italic versions. The interests of the creator of Everson Mono are reflected in the many languages in Evertype Publishing's portfolio. As a writer's font, it lacks a distinct zero.
