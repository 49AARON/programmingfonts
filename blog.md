# Anka/Coder

> "The Anka/Coder family is a monospaced, courier-width (60% of height; em size 2048x1229) font that contains characters from 437, 866, 1251, 1252 and some other code pages and can be used for source code, terminal windows etc."

It features true bold an italic variants so this font looks good all the time. Those requiring Greek and other character sets should look elsewhere though, Anka/Coder currently only supports common Latin characters. The open source files are hosted on [code.google.com](https://code.google.com/p/anka-coder-fonts/
  ). There are narrow and condensed versions for printing lots of code on little space.

Otherwise, not much is kwown about this font (other than that it looks great).

Designed by [Mark Simonson](http://www.marksimonson.com), Anonymous Pro is an evolution of the original [Anonymous](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Anonymous), adding lots of character sets and styles. It covers [all the characters (624 glyphs), styles and weights anyone will ever need](http://www.marksimonson.com/assets/content/fonts/AnonymousProSpecimen.pdf). For fans of having lots of code on screen, it even features bitmap versions for really tiny characters (without anti-aliasing). It's a truly professional option with a splash of character.

# Aurulent Sans Mono

> "Aurulent Sans is a sans serif font I'm developing for use as the primary interface font on X Windows on GNU/Linux."
[...](http://delubrum.org)

It's a bit limited, 264 Glyphs, and bold and italic need to be synthesized. The creator is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. While Aurulent may [have its flaws](http://typophile.com/node/31970), and doesn't distinguish the 0's and O's, it's a pretty good looking font considering it basically seems to be a hobby project.

[...](http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/average-mono)

The origin story for this font is mind boggling, as is its [coverage of languages](http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/average-mono) (Urdu or Runic anyone?). Not unlikely one enabled the other. Bold and italic are also in. Basically, it may not have the most character (being average and all), but it's hard to find a situation where it won't work.

# Bitstream Vera Sans Mono

It is a TrueType font with full hinting instructions, which improve its rendering quality on low-resolution devices such as computer monitors."
[...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Vera)

If to be copied is the sincerest form of flattery, Jim Lyles has much to be proud of: this has to be the [most copied font ever](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/index.php?title=Bitstream_Vera_derivatives)). A classic, this font especially well suited for use on Windows since it's fully hinted. Although Bitstream did a wonderful job, its 300 glyphs can be limiting. Luckily, it has been open sourced, inspiring the [DejaVu Project](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page) to expand the coverage of this wonderful typeface.

This is a beautiful, rounded font with loads of character. While it might not look like the most obvious choice for a programming font it's very well made and its coverage is very good. Sadly, Consolamono doesn't come with true italics. However, if you're looking for something fun and different, this might just be it.

[...](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Cousine)

This font was designed by Steve Matteson, more widely known for his work on the Droid fontfaces you'll find on any Android device. It was created especially for on-screen use, and covers regular, bold and italic in an amazing 2391 Glyphs. Compatibility might be its strongest feat, but it's a serious font for every day use.

Cutive is a thin and light typewriter font with subtle serifs. A fresh and modern take on the classic style, this wonderful writer's typeface covers the basic western character set. It doesn't have true bold and italic, and zero's and o's aren't very distinct, but that shouldn't hold you back. Get your Hemingway on and blog away with this modern classic.

You might not have missed the Turkish Lira sign, but if you did you'll be glad to know it has recently been added. DejaVu has an amazing coverage and has all the styles you'll ever need. It's classic and understated and the goto font for many coders.

Designed to carry Google Android's friendly character, Steve Matteson designed this font to be at its best on (small) screens. Sincs its initial relase it has been perfected  and expanded, making it a reliable use-anywhere font. At the same time it's fun and ligh-hearted. For some reason it lacks a true italic, and it should better distinguish o's and zeros, but it supports more languages that you can swing a smartphone at.

# Effects Eighty

The family includes normal, italic, bold, and bold italic versions. It supports the ASCII printable character set. An update with at least some Latin-1 support is planned."
[...](http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/effects-eighty)

If you're feeling nostalgic for the days of dot-matrix printers (oh the noise they made!) this is your font. Perhaps more whimsycal than than practical, Effects Eighty works as advertised. Excellent retro.

Conceived as the "the mutant child of Comic Sans and Helvetica Neue", this is fun as a programming font can get (legally at least). Make no mistakes though, this isn't Comic Sans and Fantasque Sans Mono is very serious. The open source project has seen a great many updates throughout the year.

# Fifteen

[...](http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/fifteen)

This is not just some programming font. It's designed like a bitmap font, but built as an outline font for maximum compatibility. That does however mean it only looks good at 15 pixels and doesn't have any true bold or italic styles. Indeed, it seems it could not have been made any more narrow: it is supremely efficient at getting lots of code on the screen without sacrificing readability. Fifteen is nearly halve the width of Cousine or Droid Sans, ideal for digging though log files.

Fira was designed as the default fontface for the Firefox OS. A smartphone OS looking to leverage web technology to a create a more open alternative to iOS and Android. Like the best new fonts it's a fresh design specifically developed for on-screen usage. While a true italic has been ommitted, it does cover over 1100 glyphs and should basically work everywhere. This is no cheap free font but a true professional font by a reknowned designer.

# Fixedsys

> "Fixedsys is a family of raster monospaced fonts. The name means fixed system, because its glyphs are monospace or fixed-width (although bolded characters are wider than non-bolded, unlike other monospace fonts such as Courier). It is the oldest font in Windows, and was the system font in Windows 1.0 and 2.0, where it was simply named "System". For Windows 3.x, the system font was changed to a proportional sans-serif font named System, but Fixedsys remained the default font in Notepad."

Switch to black on white, turn of anti-aliasing, set it to 10 pixels and imagine yourself back in a time when [Madonna was ground-breaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mxzs649t4) and you could get shoes with lights that would blink as you walked. Awesome? Yes. Would you want to go back? Definitely, but perhaps not indefinitely. Retro has its place though and this might bring you there without giving up modern niceties like good coffee and  [phone](http://20thcenturyprops.co.uk/65/Telephones/1980s-retro-Philips-portable-cellular-phone-P405.html) you can [fit in your pocket](http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/1/6880089/this-bent-iphone-6-poster-is-perfect).

# GNU Freefont

This isn't a designer's font, but an open source community effort to create a single font that has it all. It comes in bold and italic and has the most complete coverage of any font featured on this blog. While an OS will mix and match fonts for missing glyphs FreeFont looks to be a consistent source for anything mankind has ever put into writing. Still, every now and then new releases [improve the offering](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=freefont). If you need specific scripts or write a lot of math in LateX, this font will not let you down. It would have been better with a more distinct zero though, it lacks a slash or dot to set it apart from the capital o.

Another typical GNU project, it's like a sans version of the GNU Freefont. Not in style but in intent: its coverage is equally amazing and the project is also very active (the most recent update was last October). While the project is somewhat done, they're still pushing for compatibility and development in open tools like Fontforge. If you need your font to be reliable, you can't go wrong with GNU Unifont even though it lacks a distinct zero.

# Inconsolata

> "Inconsolata is my first serious original font release. It is a monospace font, designed for printed code listings and the like. There are a great many "programmer fonts," designed primarily for use on the screen, but in most cases do not have the attention to detail for high resolution rendering.
Inconsolata draws from many inspirations and sources. I was particularly struck by the beauty of Luc(as) de Groot's Consolas, which is his monospaced design for Microsoft's Vista release. This font, similar to his earlier TheSansMono, demonstrated clearly to me that monospaced fonts do not have to suck."
[...](http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html)

Inconsolata, inspired (also in name) by Consolas, is very well made and easy on the eyes. Its creator is a Google Android engineer, who was also involved with Google Fonts. Although this font doesn't come from a foundry it shows the designer knew what he was doing. If there is a downside it's a lack of coverage (291 glyphs) of certain scripts and true bold and italics.

It is monospaced because the typewriter fonts were like that too. A programmer may fault it for its lack of a distint zero, but on the upside it features 953 glyphs in regular, bold and italic. Perhaps not surprising considering its origin, Lekton is really a writers typeface.

# Sudo
"In 2009 I wasn’t satisfied with the available text editor fonts and decided to draw my own: Sudo. Over the last years I used it as my main font in the Terminal, as well as my text editor font for coding on Mac and Windows. Whenever something bugged me, I refined the design and could instantly evaluate if a change was an improvement."

# TeX Gyre Cursor
